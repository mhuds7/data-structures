Week 01 Assignment: Due 8/30/2019

The purpose of this assignment was to become acquainted with Cloud9 and basic JS and Linux commands. We were asked to save html files
(or websites) into text files using programming alone. We were then asked to create a md, txt files for each html file (total of 10), 
and a js file. Finally we were asked to contemplate how we would design strategies to pull the information we will need.
